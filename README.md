# Installing
1. Firstly, install `rocksdb` library
2. Secondly, install `nlohmann_json` library
3. Thirdly, build with cmake program in `rocksdb_uvm_support`:
	1. `cd rocksdb_uvm_support`
	2. `mkdir build`
	3. `cd build`
	4. `cmake ..`
	5. `make`
4. After building, need to run it:  `./rocksdb_uvm_support`. It will create column families which UVM needed
5. After column families were created - need to build `UVM`.
