# Installing
1. Firstly, install `rocksdb` library
2. Secondly, install `nlohmann_json` library
3. Thirdly, build with cmake program in `rocksdb_uvm_support`:
  1. `cd rocksdb_uvm_support`
  2. `mkdir build`
  3. `cd build`
  4. `cmake ..`
  5. `make`
4. After building, need to run it:  `./rocksdb_uvm_support`. It will create column families which UVM needed
5. After column families were created - need to build `UVM`.

# Tests

```markdown
Recent tests show that current blockhain is able to operate on ***ten thousand*** transaction easily.
**UVM** proccess with 10.000 transactions consumed:
- 22 Megabytes memory usage
- 13 threads
Block with 10.000 transactions was counted by 40 minutes with one thread on Apple M1.
```

# Dependencies

- rocksdb
- nlohmann_json
- boost
